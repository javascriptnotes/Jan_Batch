// The reason you are getting false when comparing two empty strings with &nbsp; in them is because you are not comparing two empty strings; you are comparing strings that contain the HTML entity &nbsp;, which represents a non-breaking space.

// In JavaScript, strings are compared character by character. If you compare two strings with different characters, even if they visually appear empty, the comparison will result in false. The &nbsp; entity represents a single character, and it is not an empty string.

// console.log("&nbsp;" == ""); // This will log false

// If you want to compare two empty strings, ensure that both strings are actually empty (contain no characters), like this:

// console.log("" == ""); // This will log true

// If you want to remove the non-breaking space character from a string, you can use the replace method or a regular expression to replace it with an empty string, like this:

var stringWithNbsp = "&nbsp;";
var stringWithoutNbsp = stringWithNbsp.replace(/&nbsp;/g, " ");

console.log(stringWithoutNbsp == " "); // This will log true

window.bag = bag;

// This line sets the bag element as a property of the global window object. This may be done to make the bag element accessible globally, but it's generally not recommended to attach variables to the global scope like this.
